# EU4 Ideas
Generates preview for new NI in selection screen

## Usage
1. Setup paths to idea and localisation files in paths.json
2. Run main.py
3. Move contents of out folder to your mod folder

Note: Order of files in paths.json matters, for example if you're including vanilla ideas or making submod, put the most important files first, so contents of later will be ignored when duplicate entries happen.

## Helping
While NI are generated automaticaly, text for each modifier has to be add manually through modifiers.json. If some modifiers aren't there, or are without text and you can help by filling them if you want to contribute.
